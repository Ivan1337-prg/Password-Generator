- Began with creating starting variables.
  
- Start with if statement that asks about the length of the code, that being 8-128 characters long.
  
- Open 4 window prompts that ask if the user would like uppercase/lowercase/numbers/symbols in their password.
  
- Depending on what they answer yes to, their answer is ran through an elaborate if statement that uses concat to merg arrays together, and a math.random method is used to choose random characters of the arrays.
  
- Furthermore, a for loop and function is used to randomize the password more.
  
- Join() method is used to remove commas, if there are any from the existing "finished" pass.

- Final function creates the password and auto copies it to the user's clipboard on their computer/phone/device.
